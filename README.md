### Structure

| Codebase         |                          Description                          |
| :--------------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
| [api](api)       | API written with **Go**, uses **Redis** as in-memory database |
| [webapp](webapp) |               **Nextjs** *Typescript* frontend                |

### Development

To run the API and Redis, we first have to build the necessary dependencies:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

Then, to run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

To run the frontend, you need to install Node.js and then run the below commands in the `/webapp` directory:

```sh
# first install the libraries
npm install

# then run the webapp
npm run dev
```
